        "entailment": "Human: Premise is \"Two women are embracing while holding to go packages.\" and hypothesis is \"Two woman are holding packages.\"\n\nAssistant: It's entailment. Because saying the two women are holding packages is a way to paraphrase that the packages they are holding are to go packages.\n\nHuman: Premise is \"Two young children in blue jerseys, one with the number 9 and one with the number 2 are standing on wooden steps in a bathroom and washing their hands in a sink.\" and hypothesis is \"Two kids in numbered jerseys wash their hands.\"\n\nAssistant: It's entailment.

        "contradiction": "Human: Premise is \"Two women are embracing while holding to go packages.\" and hypothesis is \"The men are fighting outside a deli.\"\n\nAssistant: It's contradiction.

Because If you're wearing a jacket, you won't be able to see the blue jerseys. When you're standing in a bathroom, you cannot be walking to school at the same time.\n\nHuman: Premise is \"A man selling donuts to a customer during a world exhibition event held in the city of Angeles\" and hypothesis is \"A woman drinks her coffee in a small cafe.\"\n\nAssistant: It's contradiction.
